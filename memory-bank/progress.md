# Progress

## What Works
- Database migrations MVP
- Materialize as query persistence layer
- Device registered events and event ingestion
- HTTP server and endpoints for healthz and metrics
- Event publishing from MQTT to Kafka
- Device ID as key for Kafka messages
- Multi-tenant support

## What's Left to Build
- Device resource API
- Sensor resource API
- OpenAPI documentation
- Configuration improvements (Viper integration)
- Database migration templates
- Additional features and bug fixes

## Current Status
- Core backend and event pipeline are functional
- APIs and integrations are expanding
- Project is in active development with ongoing improvements

## Known Issues
- Some API endpoints are incomplete (devices, sensors)
- Configuration flexibility is limited
- OpenAPI documentation is not finalized
- Potential for further optimization and scaling
