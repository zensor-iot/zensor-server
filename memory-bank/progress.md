# Progress

## What Works
- Device registration and management via HTTP API
- Event ingestion from MQTT and Kafka
- Command sequencing and dispatch to devices
- Evaluation rules for device behavior
- Task scheduling and execution
- Multi-tenant support
- HTTP API for device, event, and task management
- Integration with Materialize (query persistence layer)
- Observability (metrics, health checks)
- Scheduled tasks with cron-based scheduling
- **Replication module for local development**

## What's Left to Build
- Complete ORM wiring for replication handlers
- Additional topic handlers (evaluation rules, tasks, scheduled tasks)
- Replication conflict resolution and data consistency
- Advanced monitoring and alerting for replication
- Performance optimization for high-throughput scenarios
- Integration testing for replication module
- Documentation for replication module usage

## Current Status
- **MVP**: Complete ✅
- **Core Features**: Complete ✅
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Complete ✅
- **Replication Module**: Core implementation complete, wiring pending ⚠️

## Known Issues
- ORM dependency wiring for replication handlers needs completion
- Replication module testing and validation pending
- Need to add more comprehensive error handling for replication failures
- Monitoring and metrics for replication operations not yet implemented

## Recent Achievements
- Implemented comprehensive replication module architecture
- Created TopicHandler interface for flexible topic-specific replication
- Built DeviceHandler and TenantHandler implementations
- Added wire configuration for conditional replication service initialization
- Integrated replication service into main application flow
- Created comprehensive documentation for replication module
