# Progress

## What Works
- Device registration and management
- Event ingestion from MQTT and Kafka
- Command sequencing and dispatch to devices
- Evaluation rules for device behavior
- Task scheduling and execution
- Multi-tenant support
- HTTP API for device, event, and task management
- Integration with Materialize (query persistence layer)
- Observability (metrics, health checks)
- **Scheduled tasks with cron-based scheduling**
- **Tenant-scoped scheduled task management**
- **Scheduled task worker with minute-based evaluation**

## What's Left to Build
- Error handling for task creation failures
- Task status tracking and error descriptions
- Scheduled task execution history
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Schedule validation rules
- Task template management
- Bulk scheduled task operations

## Current Status
- Core scheduled tasks functionality implemented and building
- All components integrated with existing systems
- Ready for testing and validation
- Error handling and monitoring features planned for next iteration

## Known Issues
- No error handling for task creation failures (planned)
- No task status tracking (planned)
- No execution history (planned)
- No schedule validation (planned)
