# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Replication module implementation completed
- Replication service wiring completed for local environment
- Ready for testing and validation
- Next: Test replication functionality with actual data flow

## Recent Changes
- Implemented replication module for local development
- Created TopicHandler interface for topic-specific replication operations
- Built Replicator component that coordinates pub/sub to database replication
- Added DeviceHandler and TenantHandler implementations
- Created replication service for high-level management
- Added wire configuration for replication service (conditional on local environment)
- Updated main.go to initialize replication service in local mode
- Added comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Completed ORM wiring for replication handlers
- ✅ Added wire functions for DeviceHandler and TenantHandler
- ✅ Updated main.go to properly initialize and start replication service

## Next Steps
- Test the replication module with actual data flow
- Add more topic handlers (evaluation rules, tasks, scheduled tasks)
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Add metrics and monitoring for replication operations
- Validate that data published to topics gets persisted to database

## Open Questions / Considerations
- What additional topic handlers are needed?
- How to handle replication conflicts and data consistency?
- What monitoring and alerting should be added for replication failures?
- Should we add support for custom replication strategies?

## Replication Module Status
- ✅ Core replication infrastructure implemented
- ✅ TopicHandler interface defined
- ✅ Device and Tenant handlers created
- ✅ Service layer implemented
- ✅ Wire configuration added
- ✅ Main application integration added
- ✅ ORM wiring completed
- ✅ Handler registration and service startup implemented
- ⚠️ Testing and validation pending
- ⚠️ Additional handlers needed
