# Active Context

## Current Focus
- ✅ Fixed command type mismatch issue in LoraIntegrationWorker
- ✅ Replication module implementation completed
- ✅ Replication service wiring completed for local environment
- ✅ TaskHandler implementation completed for replicator
- ✅ Implemented missing "get device by id" endpoint
- ✅ **Refactored ScheduledTask to use Commands instead of Task**
- ✅ **Added ScheduledTaskID tracking to Task domain**
- Ready for testing and validation
- Next: Test replication functionality with actual data flow

## Recent Changes
- ✅ **Task creation response fix verified**: Functional tests confirm commands are now included in task creation response
- ✅ **Fixed task creation response**: Updated task controller to include commands in the response
- ✅ **Updated test API driver**: Fixed CreateScheduledTask to use new commands format instead of task
- ✅ **Updated Task domain model**: Changed from ScheduledTaskID to ScheduledTask reference for better association
- ✅ **Refactored ScheduledTask domain model**: Changed from having a Task reference to having Commands array directly
- ✅ **Updated Task domain model**: Added optional ScheduledTaskID field to track back to the scheduled task that created it
- ✅ **Updated database schema**: Created migrations to update scheduled_tasks and tasks tables
- ✅ **Updated persistence layer**: Modified internal models and repositories to handle the new structure
- ✅ **Updated scheduled task worker**: Modified to create tasks from scheduled task commands and set ScheduledTaskID
- ✅ **Updated HTTP API**: Modified scheduled task controller and internal models to work with commands instead of task
- ✅ **Added new repository method**: Added FindAllByScheduledTask to track task executions from scheduled tasks
- ✅ **Implemented missing "get device by id" endpoint**: Added GET /v1/devices/{id} endpoint to DeviceController
- ✅ **Added proper error handling**: Implemented 404 Not Found response for non-existent devices
- ✅ **Created TaskHandler for replicator**: Implemented task handler following the same pattern as DeviceHandler and TenantHandler
- ✅ **Added TaskHandler wire configuration**: Created InitializeTaskHandler function in wire configuration
- ✅ **Registered TaskHandler in replication service**: Updated main.go to register and start TaskHandler with replication service
- ✅ **Fixed command type mismatch issue in LoraIntegrationWorker**: Updated the worker to properly handle internal.Command to shared_kernel.Command conversion
- ✅ **Added JSON-based command conversion**: Created convertToSharedCommand method to handle type conversion via JSON marshaling/unmarshaling
- ✅ **Updated command consumption**: Changed consumeCommandsToChannel to use map[string]any for generic command consumption
- Implemented replication module for local development
- Created TopicHandler interface for topic-specific replication operations
- Built Replicator component that coordinates pub/sub to database replication
- Added DeviceHandler and TenantHandler implementations
- Created replication service for high-level management
- Added wire configuration for replication service (conditional on local environment)
- Updated main.go to initialize replication service in local mode
- Added comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Completed ORM wiring for replication handlers
- ✅ Added wire functions for DeviceHandler and TenantHandler
- ✅ Updated main.go to properly initialize and start replication service

## Next Steps
- Test the scheduled task refactoring with actual data flow
- Test the replication module with actual data flow
- Add more topic handlers (evaluation rules, scheduled tasks)
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Add metrics and monitoring for replication operations
- Validate that data published to topics gets persisted to database
- Test command flow in local mode to verify the fix works correctly

## Open Questions / Considerations
- What additional topic handlers are needed?
- How to handle replication conflicts and data consistency?
- What monitoring and alerting should be added for replication failures?
- Should we add support for custom replication strategies?
- Should we consider creating a shared command interface to avoid type conversion issues?
- How to handle scheduled task execution history and cleanup?

## Scheduled Task Refactoring Status
- ✅ **Domain Model Changes**: Updated ScheduledTask to use Commands instead of Task
- ✅ **Task Domain Updates**: Added ScheduledTaskID field for tracking
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Created migrations for updated structure
- ✅ **Persistence Layer**: Updated internal models and repositories
- ✅ **Worker Updates**: Modified scheduled task worker to create tasks from commands
- ✅ **API Updates**: Updated HTTP controller and internal models
- ✅ **Repository Methods**: Added FindAllByScheduledTask for tracking executions
- ⚠️ Testing and validation pending

## Replication Module Status
- ✅ Core replication infrastructure implemented
- ✅ TopicHandler interface defined
- ✅ Device, Tenant, and Task handlers created
- ✅ Service layer implemented
- ✅ Wire configuration added
- ✅ Main application integration added
- ✅ ORM wiring completed
- ✅ Handler registration and service startup implemented
- ⚠️ Testing and validation pending
- ⚠️ Additional handlers needed (evaluation rules, scheduled tasks)

## Command Flow Issue Resolution
- ✅ **Problem**: LoraIntegrationWorker was receiving internal.Command instead of shared_kernel.Command
- ✅ **Root Cause**: CommandPublisher publishes internal.Command, but LoraIntegrationWorker expected shared_kernel.Command
- ✅ **Solution**: Added JSON-based conversion method to handle type conversion generically
- ✅ **Implementation**: Updated consumeCommandsToChannel to use map[string]any and added convertToSharedCommand method
- ✅ **Status**: Build successful, ready for testing

## API Endpoints Status
- ✅ **GET /v1/devices**: List all devices
- ✅ **GET /v1/devices/{id}**: Get device by ID (newly implemented)
- ✅ **POST /v1/devices**: Create new device
- ✅ **PUT /v1/devices/{id}**: Update device display name
- ✅ **POST /v1/devices/{id}/commands**: Send command to device
- ✅ **Scheduled Task APIs**: Updated to work with commands instead of task
